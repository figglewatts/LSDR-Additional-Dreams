# LSDR Additional Dreams

This is a mod for [LSD: Revamped](https://github.com/figglewatts/LSDRevamped) that implements some additional dreams - it's intended to be used as bonus content for the game, as well as a demonstration of how the SDK (mod tools) can be used.

It was also used to make some tutorials.
